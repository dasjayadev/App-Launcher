*Description of the Development Process*

During the development of the cross-platform application launcher, the process was divided into three main parts: server setup, UI/UX design, and settings implementation. The project was completed with the help of the OpenAI system to ensure best practices and efficient development.

Server Setup (Part 1):

1.The first step was to set up a Node.js server using the Express framework. This server is responsible for running in the background and handling requests to launch applications on the local machine.

2.I implemented an API endpoint (/Launcher) that accepts application paths and parameters via a POST request. The server executes the corresponding command to launch the application using Node.js's child_process module.

3.The server also serves static files, making the application accessible through a web browser on any device connected to the network.

4.To ensure the API endpoint worked correctly, I used the Postman testing tool to simulate various requests and verify that the server could handle them appropriately, checking for both successful responses and error handling.

5.Time taken: Approximately 3 hours.

UI/UX Design (Part 2):

1.For the user interface, I created a simple HTML page (index.html) that lists all available applications. The UI was styled using Bootstrap for responsiveness and ease of use.

2.The page dynamically loads application icons and names based on a predefined list and interacts with the server to launch applications when icons are clicked.

3.I focused on creating a clean and intuitive interface that is similar to standard app launchers found on Android and iOS devices.

4.Time taken: Approximately 4 hours.

Settings Implementation (Part 3):

1.To manage the list of applications, I added a settings page (settings.html) that allows users to add or remove applications.

2.This page communicates with new endpoints (/apps) on the server to update the list of applications. The settings page includes a form to add new applications and a button to remove existing ones.

3.The JavaScript (settings.js) was updated to handle these new functionalities, making the application more flexible and user-friendly.

4.I used the Postman testing tool again to test the new API endpoints for adding and removing applications. This helped ensure that the server correctly processed requests to modify the application list and handled edge cases effectively.

5.Time taken: Approximately 4 hours.

Overall Project Completion:

The project was completed in a total of approximately 11 hours, with each part of the project carefully implemented and tested to ensure a functional, cross-platform launcher that is easy to use and manage from any device on the network.

With the assistance of the OpenAI system and thorough testing using Postman, I was able to efficiently structure and develop the application, ensuring best practices and optimized code throughout the project.
